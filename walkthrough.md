# Night of the Kamaitachi: REBIRTH Walkthrough

This is a Walkthrough for the [fan-translation of Kamaitachi no Yoru Rinne Saisei](https://projectkamai.com). It is loosely based on [the Seiya Saiga Walkthrough](https://seiya-saiga.com/game/5pb/kamaitachi_pc.html), but this one is simplified and effectively spoiler-free. I will mostly be using IDs of scenes/endings/choices to convey information, as to avoid spoilers from Scene/Route titles and choices. Any scene/route/ending titles will be marked as [](#spoiler "spoilers") (hover to view).

This walkthrough will not guide you through every minor choice, since those are pretty self explanatory. Instead, I will only focus on how to get to all routes. Once you're there, you should be able to get every ending yourself. If you really want every last little bit of flavor text after finishing all endings, please refer to [the Seiya Saiga Walkthrough (Google Translate)](https://seiya--saiga-com.translate.goog/game/5pb/kamaitachi_pc.html?_x_tr_sl=ja&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=de&_x_tr_pto=nui).

## Terminology

To keep this guide spoiler-free, I will refer to IDs provided within the game. This section explains the exact types of IDs I'm referring to and how to interpret this guide, in case you're confused as to what exactly I'm referring to.

**JUMP X**: Use the flowchart to jump to the scene with ID X.

**SCENE X-X**: This section of the guide is for unlocking Scenes X through X viewable in the Extras > Playlog menu. This is used to refer to routes without using their title.

**END X**: This refers to ending X, viewable in the Extras > Playlog menu. This is used to refer to endings without using their names.

**> X**: At the choice following your previous action, select the option marked with the letter X.

## Getting Started

If you've looked up this guide before starting the VN, I'd suggest not using it until you've exhausted all the choices. The first route is essentially like a puzzle and not terribly difficult to solve without a guide.

When using this guide, I expect that you will go back and try every option for every choice that you haven't tried already. Do not skip anything. Otherwise, you risk getting confused about what to do next, even with this guide (especially after Section 2).

Routes are listed in no particular order. As long as you stick with the section appropriate for the part of the game you're in, you can play them in any order you want. Any exceptions will be explicitly mentioned.

This guide is split into 3 sections:

1. The first route
2. Routes accessible after completing the first route
3. Routes accessible after completing the routes from Section 2 ([](#spoiler "After the Pink Bookmark appears"))

## Section 1

**The first route - DO NOT USE THIS SECTION UNLESS YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO!**

Since you're here, I assume you were not able to solve the puzzle on your own and have seen all branches that are available to you at this point.

---

**HINT:** Re-read END [](#spoiler "7"), as this one makes it fairly obvious who the killer is.

To access this Ending: JUMP 80 > B > END [](#spoiler "7")

---

If you still can't figure it out, here is the solution:

JUMP 55 > Type [](#spoiler "mikimoto") > END 1/2/3

JUMP 90 > Type [](#spoiler "mikimoto") > END 4

JUMP 116 > Type [](#spoiler "mikimoto") > END 5

---

There is an additional Ending you can get here as well:

JUMP 116 > Type [](#spoiler "haruko") > END 10

---

Aside from the ones mentioned above, the following additional Endings are obtainable here:
- END 6 [](#spoiler "Pole Position")
- END 8 [](#spoiler "Room Service")
- END 9 [](#spoiler "Mopped Up")
- END 11 [](#spoiler "A Trip Downstairs")
- END 12 [](#spoiler "Mr. President")
- END 43 [](#spoiler "Just Kidding...")

---

## Section 2

**After the first route**

Now that you're here, you should've completed the [](#spoiler "Mystery") route and gotten all of the obtainable endings there. If you haven't, please go back and do so. You might not be able to proceed otherwise.

---

### SCENE 121-129 [](#spoiler "Mari in Limbo")
JUMP 5 > D

Obtainable Endings:
- END 46 [](#spoiler "Mari in Limbo")

---

### SCENE 48-64 [](#spoiler "Spy")
This one is a bit tricky to get to. It also has some overlap with SCENE 65-74. However, the full path is described here in case you play the other route first:

JUMP 1 > A > B > A > B > B > B > B > B > B > B > C > A > C > C

If you already got to the [](#spoiler "Occult") route (SCENE 65-74), you can use this simplified path:

JUMP 172 > B > B > B > B > B > C > A > C > C

Obtainable Endings:
- END 15 [](#spoiler "Haruko...")
- END 16 [](#spoiler "Midori...")
- END 17 [](#spoiler "Gunfire in the Wind")
- END 14 [](#spoiler "The Legendary Spy (Revisited)")

---

### SCENE 65-74 [](#spoiler "Occult")
This one is also tricky to get to and has some overlap with SCENE 48-64. The full path is described here in case you play the other route first.

JUMP 1 > A > B > A > B > B > A > B > A > A > D > A > A > B

If you already got to the [](#spoiler "Spy") route (SCENE 48-64), you can use this simplified path:

JUMP 172 > A > B > A > A > D > A > A > B

Obtainable Endings:
- END 18 [](#spoiler "When She Wakes")
- END 19 [](#spoiler "Until She Smiles Again")

---

### SCENE 79-82 [](#spoiler "Night of the Kamaitaichi")
JUMP 1 > B

Obtainable Endings:
- END 20 [](#spoiler "Night of the Kamaitaichi")

---

### SCENE 75-78 [](#spoiler "Snow Maze")
JUMP 1 > A > B > B

Obtainable Endings:
- END 13 [](#spoiler "Catastrophe...")

---

### SCENE 113-120 [](#spoiler "Mari's Detective Story")
This one should be self explanatory, since the game will outright ask you if you want to start this route after obtaining END 3.

If you missed this or closed the dialog, here's how to get there again:

JUMP 260

Obtainable Endings:
- END 44 [](#spoiler "Success (Detective Mari)")
- END 45 [](#spoiler "Failure (Detective Mari)")

---

### SCENE 130-142 [](#spoiler "A Novel")
Like with SCENE 113-120, the game will outright ask you if you want to start this route once you unlock it.

This route is also accessible from the main menu by selecting Extras > [](#spoiler "A Novel"). Spoiler marking is for the sake of consistency, since the menu option contains the name of the route.

Obtainable Endings:
- END 47 [](#spoiler "A Novel")

---

## Section 3

**The final stretch**

Now that you've gotten here, I assume you've already gotten the [](#spoiler "Pink Bookmark"). If not, go back to the routes you've previously read and try all the choices you haven't selected so far. It should appear at some point. I believe it appeared for me on one of the Bad Endings obtainable on the [](#spoiler "Spy") route. Though I honestly have no idea what exactly causes it to appear. It should definitely appear at some point while reading the routes mentioned in Section 2.

---

### SCENE 84-87 [](#spoiler "The Comedy of O")
JUMP 2 > B > B > B > A > B > A

Obtainable Endings:
- END 21 [](#spoiler "The Comedy of O")

---

### SCENE 88-93 [](#spoiler "Cryptography")
JUMP 39 > C > C > B

There is an additional secret ending on this route after obtaining END 22 and END 23, obtainable like this:

JUMP 220 > C

**Do not use skip mode from here.** 

Once you get to the message that reads [](#spoiler "A smile crept over his face. It was kind of disconcerting, to be honest.") press the Z key. If you changed your key mappings, press the key you mapped to the function "Go back to previous line".

Obtainable Endings:
- END 22 [](#spoiler "Are you Kidding Me, Kobayashi?")
- END 23 [](#spoiler "Sure, Kobayashi")
- END 24 [](#spoiler "Chunsoft Party Conspiracy")

---

### SCENE 94-112 [](#spoiler "Labyrinth")
**NOTE:** Before you can get to this route, you need to obtain END 24 from the [](#spoiler "Cryptography") route (SCENE 88-93).

JUMP 202 > B > B > A

Obtainable Endings:
- END 25 [](#spoiler "Li'l Labby")
- END 26 [](#spoiler "Lodgie")
- END 27 [](#spoiler "I Fell Asleep")
- END 28 [](#spoiler "Muramasa, the Demon Blade")
- END 29 [](#spoiler "I Got Roasted")
- END 30 [](#spoiler "We Got Roasted")
- END 31 [](#spoiler "Door 4")
- END 32 [](#spoiler "Door 2")
- END 33 [](#spoiler "Door #")
- END 34 [](#spoiler "Door 6")
- END 35 [](#spoiler "Door 9")
- END 36 [](#spoiler "Door 3")
- END 37 [](#spoiler "Door 1")
- END 38 [](#spoiler "Door *")
- END 39 [](#spoiler "Door 5")
- END 40 [](#spoiler "Door 0")
- END 41 [](#spoiler "Door 8")
- END 42 [](#spoiler "The Box of Unhappiness")

If you're missing END 10 after Section 2 and Section 3, please refer to Section 1.
